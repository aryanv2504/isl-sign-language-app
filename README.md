# 🤟 ISL Sign Language App  
Real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) letter recognition using a TensorFlow Lite deep learning model, and a modern Streamlit interface.

This project uses your webcam to detect Indian Sign Language alphabets by analyzing hand landmarks and passing the cropped image into a TensorFlow Lite model.  
The interface is clean, centered, and designed for fast real-time predictions with temporal smoothing and automatic gesture locking.
